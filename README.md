Step 1: Set Up PySpark on GCP
Create a GCP Account: If you don't have one already, create a GCP account.
Create a Dataproc Cluster:
Go to GCP Console: Open the GCP Console and navigate to Dataproc.
Create Cluster: Click on "Create Cluster", select the appropriate configuration (e.g., number of nodes, machine type, etc.).

Step 2: Write the Scala Code
Write a Scala program to implement the PageRank algorithm using Spark's GraphX library. Create a new Scala file, for example, PageRank.scala.


Step 3: Compile and Upload the Scala Code
Use SBT (Scala Build Tool) to compile your Scala code. 

Summary
Set Up PySpark on GCP: Create a Dataproc cluster.
Write Scala Code: Implement the PageRank algorithm using Scala and GraphX.
Compile and Upload: Compile the Scala code using SBT and upload the JAR file to Google Cloud Storage.
Submit Job: Submit the compiled JAR file as a Spark job on your Dataproc cluster.
